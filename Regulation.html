					<p id = "articleText">Most sports performance drugs are legal meaning it is up to the different sports associations to regulate the use of these drugs on their athletes. Here we will look at which drugs are allowed for which sports.</p>

					<p id = "articleText">The main association which regulates the use of drugs in sports is the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) which has a comprehensive list of substances which can be found here. I will speak of the sport-specific drug regulation. For example, in all but a few sports, ethanol alcohol is allowed. The sports in which it is not allowed are ones which require the use of a motorized vehicle such as Motorcycling or a weapon such as Archery. The other substances which are allowed in most sports but not all are beta-blockers. This drug is not allowed in several sports such as Archery, Automobile, Billiards, Darts, Golf, Shooting,  Skiing/Snowboarding, and Underwater sports.</p>

					<p id = "articleText">One thing that you may not think needed regulation would be eSports. This new type of sport has just risen in the past few years and has not needed drug regulation yet because after all, Itâ€™s just a video game. But that might change in the coming years since doping in the sport is rampant. So many esports athletes are using drugs to increase reaction time etc. for their advantage.</p>

					<p id = "articleText">In general most sports just follow the regulations set by WADA but there are some associations that have their own list.</p>
