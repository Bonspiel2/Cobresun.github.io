					<p id = "articleText">Performance enhancing drugs are often times easy to get and easy to use. This is the huge problem with them. Although most if not all associations have some sort of ban on these substances, it is not always followed by all the athletes. Let’s be honest in knowing that they’re not going to check some under 18 baseball tournament to see if some young athlete is on an over the table drug. This would just take too much time and money to do which is why there are many kids out there doping because they won’t get caught. I curl competitively in southern Alberta and I can tell you not once have I been tested for any sort of drug. I could start doping tomorrow and I doubt anyone would notice until I get to the world stage. But this all comes back to the misconception that sports are to win not to have fun. We have made such a competitive society that we are taught to win at all costs. I recently took a coaching course and they had to teach us how to deal with competitive parents. Our instructor told us about certain parents that were so competitive that they make their kids take sports performance drugs to ensure they win. But I mean who wouldn’t want to win? It’s an amazing feeling standing on a podium accepting your medal. This is the reason why people use performance enhancing drugs is to feel the glory of winning. Sure they run the risk of getting caught but like I said before, people want to win at all costs. And let’s not forget that they are drugs. They can have some serious long term physical effect on people. Symptoms can range from infertility to schizophrenia to heart attacks which can cause death. This is just another added risk to taking these drugs. In conclusion, the competitive nature of our society has forced certain people in to the use of performance enhancing drugs despite the risk of disqualification and the long term physical health issues.</p>
