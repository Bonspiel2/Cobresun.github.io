					<p id = "articleText">Performance enhancing drugs are divided up in to three classes: androstenedione, creatine, anabolic steroids, and ephedrine. All these with the exception of anabolic steroids are over the counter drugs meaning anyone could go to their local drug store and pick them up.
					</p>

					<p id = "articleText">	The first class, androstenedione, comes in pill form and, when used, increases testosterone in the liver. Because of the increase of this hormone, your body begins to develop more muscle and strength which would most definitely have an effect on the outcome of a game if it depends on strength. On top of that, this class can cause irreversible gynecomastia, the premature closure of growth plates, acne, hair loss, change in personality, and possible aggressive behaviour. With certain dosages, addiction could be a possibility. </p>

					<p id = "articleText">	The next class, creatine, is sold as a fine white powder. Creatine is essential to the creation of ATP meaning that while using the substance, your body will produce more energy faster meaning you can train harder and more often which means faster results. But letâ€™s not forget the adverse effects of this drug. The main problem is that while using the drug, you are guaranteed to gain weight. The first bit of weight will be water but the rest will be muscle mass. The catch with gaining muscle mass is you need to take advantage of the extra energy, otherwise it turns into water weight. Although this drug is not banned in most sporting events and is easy to access, scientists recommend against people under 18 using it because of the lack of studies. As well, the fact that young athletes are in a growing phase meaning it would be easier for the drug to cause a torn muscle which could lead to permanent damage.</p>

					<p id = "articleText">	The third class is anabolic steroids. This drug is either taken orally or injected into the muscle and it produces extra testosterone. It is a prescribed drug and can treat certain issues like hormone deficiency and diseases that result in a loss of muscle like cancer or aids. The doses used by athletes can be 10 to 100 times the amount prescribed for those diseases. Anabolic steroids are probably the most dangerous performance enhancing drug because it can cause things like kidney failure, damage to the liver, cardiovascular problems, high blood pressure, and an increased risk for heart attacks and strokes.There are also several gender and age specific symptoms such as infertility, gynecomastia, baldness, and increased risk of prostate cancer for men, facial hair, baldness, change in menstrual cycle, and deepened voice for women, and stunted growth for adolescents. This drug is banned in most sporting events.</p>


					<p id = "articleText">	The last class is ephedrine which comes in pill form and is to be taken orally. It can relieve shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing due to bronchial asthma. This means that is is most commonly used to treat asthma but has also been found to improve sports performance. It is currently illegal to use this substance in most sports associations. There are many short term side effects with this drug, things like nausea, dizziness, and anxiety but as for long term effects, prolonged use can cause schizophrenia which leads to conditions like poor nutrition and hygiene, fever, cold sweats, and dilated pupils.</p>
